# Word-Guess-Game
A simplified version of hangman.  The player is presented with a hidden word and must use their keyboard to guess the letters.  If the player spells out the word before guessing incorrectly 6 times, they earn a win; otherwise a loss.  Once a new round starts, the previous word is displayed.  The next word is displayed automatically at the end of each round.

## Limitations
* Any key can be pressed, non-letter keys will be displayed as a guess.
* Only 5 words are present.
* Words are presented sequentially.

### Future Improvements
* Add more words to increase playing time and difficulty.
* Randomise word selection.
* Only display previous word if guessed correctly.
* Add graphics, e.g. parts of a car as hangman.
* Add sound effects and background music.
* Add additional styling to support theme.
